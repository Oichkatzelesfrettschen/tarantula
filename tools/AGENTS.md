# Utility Scripts

Scripts for analyzing and working with the source tree.
Examples:
- `analyze_codebase.py` – count source files.
- `generate_cscope.sh` and `generate_ctags.sh` – index helpers.
- `build_collect_warnings.sh` – build and capture warnings.
- `generate_compiledb.sh` – produce a compile database for clang-tidy.
No automated tests are required to modify these scripts.
