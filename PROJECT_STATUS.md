# Project Status

## Recent Updates
- Added compatibility typedef for run counters in `src-headers/exokernel.h`.
- Included `<stdio.h>` and `<math.h>` in `src-headers/sys/systm.h` to avoid warnings.
- Consolidated build directory ignore patterns.
- `.gitignore` now ignores `build*/`, `builds/`, and `*/CMakeFiles/`.
- Verified the repository contains no residual build directories.
