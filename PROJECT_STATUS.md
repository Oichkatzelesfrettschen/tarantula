# Project Status

## Recent Updates
- Added compatibility typedef for run counters in `src-headers/exokernel.h`.
- Included `<stdio.h>` and `<math.h>` in `src-headers/sys/systm.h` to avoid warnings.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `build_*`, `builds/`, and `*/CMakeFiles/` directories.
- Removed the temporary `build/` directory.
